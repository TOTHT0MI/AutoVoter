# AutoVoter

AutoVoter is a very simple chrome extension, that fills in usernames automatically when voting for a Minecraft server on many voting sites.
This is literally a very basic, 10 minutes project, but can be very useful.

At the moment it's still in development, but after that I'll make it available as a proper extension.

I will soon provide a detailed guide on how to install the extension, as I do not plan to release it to the extension store just yet.

Planned features:

- Better settings page
- Popup
- auto captcha (clicks captcha, user needs to complete the captcha)
- auto submit
